palvelinten hallinta s22 homework 4

First, I opened the nano -text editor, where I made the script (heimaailma.sh), which looked like this:

And this is the helloworld.sh script:

After that I changed both files rights with the command <chmod +x heimaailma.sh, helloworld.sh>, so that I can access them.

I tried to apply the script several times for the slave, but it always gave me this same error:

So after many hours of trying to google the answer and configuring some settings I just couldn't apply the command to the slave.
